Problem
Studies have shown that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often have difficulty detecting, recognizing, and correlating emotions from facial expressions; this cognitive impairment tends to worsen with age. This makes integrating them into society a challenge.

Target User Group
High-functioning autistic children of third grade or higher, with the ability to read and comprehension of their reading, and their instructors.

Solution
We aid autistic children in learning to express emotion through three simple tasks. 
Learn emotions through flashcards. 
Practice emoting through a facial recognition game. 
Take a multiple-choice quiz on emotion to test their knowledge.
